Uber Data Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Power BI to analyze Uber rides data. The dashboard allows for in-depth exploration of ride patterns, including ride durations, distances, pricing, and more. Through this project, I revisited key skills in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), data visualization, and data analysis, while applying best practices for dashboard design and data storytelling.

Features
Interactive Dashboard: View insights through interactive visuals that allow users to explore ride trends across various dimensions.

Dynamic Visualizations: Utilize Power BIâ€™s features such as charts, tables, slicers, and KPIs to represent key metrics like ride duration, distance, cost, and peak hours.

Data Insights: Provides deep analysis on ride patterns, including time-of-day insights, ride frequency, price variations, and more.

Skills Developed
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Optimized calculations and worked with time intelligence functions to provide accurate and insightful metrics.

Data Visualization: Created dynamic, user-friendly visuals to communicate data in an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing manner.

Data Analysis: Analyzed and processed large datasets, uncovering valuable patterns and trends that provide actionable insights.

Dataset
This project uses the Uber Rides Dataset, which contains ride details such as:

Ride duration

Distance traveled

Ride cost

Pickup and dropoff locations (latitude, longitude)

Time of day, day of the week, and more

The dataset has been processed and cleaned for analysis, with transformations applied to create key performance indicators and metrics for the dashboard.
