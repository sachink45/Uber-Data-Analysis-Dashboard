# Uber-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Power BI to analyze Uber rides data. The dashboard allows for in-depth exploration of ride patterns, including ride durations, distances, pricing, and more. Through this project, I revisited key skills in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), data visualization, and data analysis, while applying best practices for dashboard design and data storytelling.

## Features
Interactive Dashboard: View insights through interactive visuals that allow users to explore ride trends across various dimensions.

## Dynamic Visualizations
Utilize Power BIâ€™s features such as charts, tables, slicers, and KPIs to represent key metrics like ride duration, distance, cost, and peak hours.
Created dynamic, user-friendly visuals to communicate data in an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing manner.

## Data Insights
Provides deep analysis on ride patterns, including time-of-day insights, ride frequency, price variations, and more.

## Skills Developed
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Optimized calculations and worked with time intelligence functions to provide accurate and insightful metrics.
cleaned for analysis, with transformations applied to create key performance indicators and metrics for the dashboard.
